## An analytics project that exposes some interesting points about the dataset 

This project made use of SQL to clean and explore the data. It also made use of PowerBI for visualization

### With MySQL this project does;
  - Data Cleaning
      * Creates a new table from the existing table and copies all the data into this new table in order to preserve the original data
      * In the new table, it checks for duplicates and removes any duplicate found to ensure the data is not redundant

    - Exploratory Analysis
      * Finds the top 5 artits
      * Finds the top 10 popular tracks
      * Finds the Percentage of top 10 danceable tracks
      * Exposes the top 10 longest tracks in "minutes.seconds"
      * Keys of the top 10 popular tracks
      * Most used keys by the top 5 artists
      * Classify fast and slow-beat songs by using tempo
      * Finds the most common mode
      * Modes of the top 10 popular tracks
      * Tempo Category of the top 10 popular tracks

### With Microsoft PowerBI this project visualizes;
  * Top 3 artists
  * Top 10 popular tracks
  * Top 10 Danceable tracks
  * Top 10 longest tracks
  * Keys of the top 10 popular tracks
  * Keys used by top 3 artists
